# Loading data into R {#loadingData}

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(GeoLocTools)
setupGeolocation()
```

The first step is to load your raw data into R. Different geolocator types (e.g. from different manufacturers or different series) provide raw data in different formats. And while there are functions available to read a whole range of formats, you may have to eiter write your own function, use simple read text utilites or get in touch with the package managers to write code that fits your format if it is not yet implemented.

The most frequently used geolocators provide files with the extention, .lux (Migrate Technology Ltd), .lig (BAS, Biotrack) or .glf (Swiss Ornithological Insitute). The functions `readMTlux`, `ligTrans` and `glfTrans` allows you to read these files. The documentations of the different packages may help to provide information on how to read other fiels (e.g. `?GeoLight`).


>A short note on ***naming and saving of data files*** (final results and intermediate steps):
>We have already discussed, that it makes sense to have a certain fixed folder structure for the analysis of geolocators. It not only helps to keep track of all files and analysis, but most importantly it allows to run the same code for saving and reading of data once you defined a set of metadata information.

With the suggested data structure, we can then define metadata information on the individual, the species, as the deployment location.

```{r}
ID <- "14SA"
Species <- "MerApi"
wd <- "data"

lon.calib <- 11.96
lat.calib <- 51.32
```

By using the above metadata we can use the `paste0` command to include this information in reading and writing of files.

```{r}
raw <- glfTrans(paste0(wd, "/RawData/", Species, "/", ID, ".glf"))
  names(raw) <- c("Date", "Light")
  raw$Light  <- log(raw$Light+0.0001) + abs(min(log(raw$Light+0.0001)))
head(raw)
```

> Note: In this case it is required log transform the ligth data. In addition, we add a small value since the night readings are sometimes smaller than zero, values that cannot be log transformed.

Adding to the confucion of different raw data types, the read functions also provide different output. However, the most important columns are,

1. Date
2. Light


and these columns need to be in a specific format with Date beeing a `POSIX.` class and light beeing numeric intergers. Check with the following line of code:

```{r}
str(raw)
```
